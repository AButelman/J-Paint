### My additions:

### Shift key to make squares, circles and horizontal and vertical lines
### Stroke size
### Eraser
### Depth, for a 'tridimensional' feel
### Clear button
### Undo and redo
### File opening and saving with Java Paint extension
### Exporting and importing BMP, JPG, PNG and GIF files
### Menus and shortcuts for all non painting operations
### Background colors on the stroke color and fill color buttons
